Over a milllinea ago, the Elementalist began practicing magic. A combination of raw talent and exceptional dedication to practice caused him to excell. His teacher began to fear the boy's thirst for power with no regards to cost, and tried to slow him down. The Elementalist grew angry, and accused his master of jealousy. Flying into a rage, he slew the master and other students, taking over the study and using their collective knowledge to launch his skills even further.

The Elementalist soon developed a new form for magic: glyphs. These glyphs draw magic from artifacts, ley lines, and any other source they are inscribed upon. His first use was to inscribe a series of glyphs to imbue him with life energy, preventing him from aging. Then he started mastering the elements, giving himself both projection against them as well empowering the spells he wields.

For the past few centruies, the Elementalist has travelled the continent as a strange recluse. He wanders from town to town, occasionally trading for strange items or weird artifacts. It is unclear whether he is searching for something in particular or just an eccentric collector passing the time bartering for curios. Every so often something manages to draw his ire, and that is when he unleashes his full power.

Death and destruction soon follow when he unleashes his rage. He destroys all he can see, levelling buildings and burning fields. This time however it seems something else is amiss. His rage has subsided, yet the destruction continues. He appears to be destroying a giant swath of the countryside, almost as though he is attempting to create a massive, continent sized glyph.
