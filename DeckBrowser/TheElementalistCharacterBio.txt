The Elementalist is a strange recluse. He wanders from town to town, occasionally trading for strange items or weird artifacts. It is unclear whether he is searching for something in particular or just an eccentric collector passing the time bartering for curios. Every so often something manages to draw his ire, and that is when he unleashes his full power.

Death and destruction soon follow when he unleashes his rage. He destroys all he can see, levelling buildings and burning fields. This time however it seems something else is amiss. After reducing Ferryman's Wharf to a smoldering crater, he still has not calmed, and now makes for the capitol city.
